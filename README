This is the "bug fix" version of "verilog_systemverilog.vim" vimscript #1586 created by Amit Sethi.

With this fixed version, the key "%" (matchit.vim) works for Verilog/SystemVerilog files, which doesn't work for the original version.

The fix is done based on version 1.2 of "verilog_systemverilog.vim".

Changes by Eddie:

Added folding expression:
Currently folds functions, tasks

Added matchit words for matchit.vim

Added ovm functions, based on http://verifideas.blogspot.com/2008/09/better-syntax-highlighting-in.html
